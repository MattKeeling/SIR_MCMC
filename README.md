This is a repository of the matlab code that is linked to the PLoS Computational Biology paper "A retrospective assessment of forecasting the peak of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 wave in England" by Keeling & Dyson.

Running the Main_Run file will generate a set of figures similar to Figure 3 in the main paper. The run time can be substantially improved by compiling sections of the MCMC section of the code and using mex files.
